**Purpose of this app:**
>To plan, design, and build a fullstack, sveltekit, E Commerce Shopping app. Why? To add an up-to-date project that demonstrates my Fullstack skills. I haven't done a good job of keeping track of, or staying up to >date on previous projects, and I wanted a project I can build that shows exactly what I can do. This includes areas I need to improve in, which includes Documentation, Testing, etc.
