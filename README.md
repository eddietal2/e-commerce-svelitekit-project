**Purpose of this app:**
>To plan, design, and build a fullstack, sveltekit, E Commerce Shopping app. Why? To add an up-to-date project that demonstrates my Fullstack skills. I haven't done a good job of keeping track of, or staying up to >date on previous projects, and I wanted a project I can build that shows exactly what I can do. This includes areas I need to improve in, which includes Documentation, Testing, etc.

**Stack Used**
* SvelteKit (https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction)
* TaildwindCSS (https://tailwindcss.com/)
* ShadCN-Svelte (https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/)
* Linear for Project Management (https://linear.app/)
* Gemini & Claud  (https://claude.ai/ & https://gemini.google.com/)
  -- I use "AI" for debugging help, ideation, research, and learning. I do NOT use AI to code apps for me. If I do generate AI Code, its small, isolated chunks that I can produce on my own, and debug on my own.

**Back-end**
